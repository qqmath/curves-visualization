# Spiral Visualization with Streamlit

This interactive article demonstrates different types of spirals using Streamlit. It allows users to explore various spiral shapes and adjust parameters to observe their behavior.

## Cardioid Spiral

The Cardioid spiral resembles a heart shape. Users can adjust the number of points and turns to explore different variations of this spiral.

#### Interactive Widget
- **Number of points in Cardioid spiral**: Slider to control the number of points in the Cardioid spiral.
- **Number of turns in Cardioid spiral**: Slider to control the number of turns in the Cardioid spiral.

## Astroid Spiral

The Astroid spiral resembles a star shape. Users can customize its appearance by adjusting the number of points and turns.

#### Interactive Widget
- **Number of points in Astroid spiral**: Slider to control the number of points in the Astroid spiral.
- **Number of turns in Astroid spiral**: Slider to control the number of turns in the Astroid spiral.

## Trochoid Spiral

The Trochoid spiral consists of two circles. Users can experiment with different angle and radius multipliers to observe the spiral's behavior.

#### Interactive Widget
